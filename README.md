Requirements:
- Latest [stable](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.11.3) or [nightly](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) Neovim build
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Optional:
    - [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
    - [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)

Backup your existing Neovim config if you have one:

```bash 
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak ```

Clone this repository:

```git clone https://github.com/j-yon/neovim.git ~/.config/nvim```

Then, just launch Neovim. Lazy should automatically install all plugins. From here, feel free to customize the setup to your liking.
