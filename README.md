# Neovim

One of a *lot* of structured Neovim configurations that I am personalizing to my needs and desires. The initial build started as a single file configuration from [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim); this file is still accessible in `/kickstart/kickstart_init.lua` but is not used in any way currently. I will continue to add plugins and further configuration as I learn how to use Neovim better.
